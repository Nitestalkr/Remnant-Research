# GRAO Tooling Scripts

## Overview

Four Node.js scripts that power the TPG-GRAO pipeline: trace collection, gradient derivation, loop history retrieval, and proposal generation.

> **Note:** These scripts are designed for the live local OpenClaw environment. They are published here as part of the research mirror. Some trace collection functions use simulated data when running outside the live system. The scripts are functional but not yet packaged for standalone use by external users.

## Status

| Script | Status | Last Validated |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| `trace-collector.js` | ✅ Operational | Round 40 (2026-05-10) |
| `gradient-deriver.js` | ✅ Operational | Round 40 (2026-05-10) |
| `grao-retriever.js` | ✅ Operational | Round 40 (2026-05-10) |
| `proposal-generator.js` | ✅ Operational | Round 40 (2026-05-10) |

## Quick Start — Run Full Pipeline

```bash
cd tpg-grao/scripts

# Step 1: Collect traces (all 7 sources, 24h window)
node trace-collector.js

# Step 2: Derive gradients from collected traces (7d window)
node gradient-deriver.js

# Step 3: Generate proposals from strong gradients (threshold 0.50)
node proposal-generator.js

# Step 4: Analyze loop history and generate trend report
node grao-retriever.js
```

Or target specific sources / thresholds:

```bash
node trace-collector.js --sources agent,stability,external_api --window 12h
node gradient-deriver.js --window 30d --threshold 0.60
node proposal-generator.js --threshold 0.70 --novelty 60
node grao-retriever.js --rounds 10 --metrics gradients,health
```

## Scripts

### trace-collector.js

Collects and normalizes raw traces from all signal sources.

**Usage:** `node trace-collector.js [--sources all|agent|research|stability|experience|external_api|deployment|user_interaction] [--output traces/] [--window 24h]`

**Input sources:**
- `agent` — Cron execution logs, tool usage, model calls
- `research` — arXiv scan results, paper downloads, deep dive outputs
- `stability` — Memory usage, storage health, gateway status, cron reliability
- `experience` — Optimized workflows, learned patterns
- `external_api` — Nostr relay health, Paperclip API status (placeholder-backed)
- `deployment` — Agent activation events, system restarts (placeholder-backed)
- `user_interaction` — Telegram/Discord message logs (placeholder-backed)

**Note:** The 3 new source types (`external_api`, `deployment`, `user_interaction`) are implemented in code but currently placeholder-backed. They would read from real data in production.

**Output:** Validated, deduplicated JSON trace files in `traces/YYYY-MM-DD/`

**Key behaviour:**
- Content-hash deduplication (1-minute window) prevents duplicate traces
- Schema validation per signal type — missing required fields are rejected
- Enriches traces with confidence score based on data completeness
- Updates `grao/grao-state.json` with last collection timestamp

---

### gradient-deriver.js

Computes directional gradients from collected traces using pattern analysis.

**Usage:** `node gradient-deriver.js [--traces traces/] [--output gradients/] [--window 7d] [--threshold 0.30]`

**Algorithm:**
1. Load traces within time window from `traces/`
2. Cluster by signal type (agent / research / stability / experience)
3. Compute pattern strength per cluster (source diversity × confidence × temporal consistency)
4. Apply temporal adjustment (accelerating +20%, decaying −20%)
5. Classify gradient type: `directional` (research/experience), `magnitude` (stability), `temporal` (agent)
6. Store gradients in `gradients/`, archive those older than 30 days

**Output:** JSON gradient files in `gradients/` + updated `grao/grao-state.json`

---

### grao-retriever.js

Retrieves and analyzes GRAO loop history for trend analysis and report generation.

**Usage:** `node grao-retriever.js [--rounds N] [--metrics all|gradients|proposals|health] [--output reports/] [--window 30]`

**Analysis:**
- Loads loop logs from `grao/loops/`
- Analyzes gradient direction trends over time
- Tracks proposal status distribution (pending / active / completed)
- Reads system health from `grao/grao-state.json`
- Generates findings and recommendations

**Output:** JSON trend report saved to `reports/`

---

### proposal-generator.js

Generates research proposals from gradient analysis.

**Usage:** `node proposal-generator.js [--gradients gradients/] [--threshold 0.50] [--output proposals/] [--novelty 30]`

**Logic:**
1. Load all gradients from `gradients/`
2. Filter to those meeting magnitude threshold (default: 0.50)
3. Novelty check — skip directions recently investigated (active, completed, or rejected within novelty window)
4. Confidence check — skip gradients below 0.30 confidence
5. Generate proposal JSON with hypothesis, methodology, timeline, priority
6. Write to `proposals/` with status `"pending"`
7. Update `grao/grao-state.json`

**Proposal priorities:** `high` (magnitude ≥ 0.80) · `medium` (≥ 0.50) · `low` (< 0.50)

## Shared Dependencies

- All scripts read/write the shared state file at `grao/grao-state.json`
- Trace format defined in `traces/README.md`
- Gradient format defined in `gradients/README.md`
- Proposal format defined in `proposals/README.md`

## Design Principles

- **Idempotent** — Safe to re-run; existing files are never overwritten
- **Graceful degradation** — Missing directories or empty inputs produce warnings, not crashes
- **Content-addressed** — Trace deduplication uses SHA-256 content hashes
- **State-aware** — Each script updates `grao-state.json` so the pipeline has shared context
